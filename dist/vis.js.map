currently needs to always\n  be passed to clustering methods\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n# State Model for Clustering\n\nThe total state for clustering is non-trivial. It is useful to have a model\navailable as to how it works. The following documents the relevant state items.\n\n\n## Network State\n\nThe following `network`-members are relevant to clustering:\n\n- `body.nodes`       - all nodes actively participating in the network\n- `body.edges`       - same for edges\n- `body.nodeIndices` - id's of nodes that are visible at a given moment\n- `body.edgeIndices` - same for edges\n\nThis includes:\n\n- helper nodes for dragging in `manipulation`\n- helper nodes for edge type `dynamic`\n- cluster nodes and edges\n- there may be more than this.\n\nA node/edge may be missing in the `Indices` member if:\n\n- it is a helper node\n- the node or edge state has option `hidden` set\n- It is not visible due to clustering\n\n\n## Clustering State\n\nFor the hashes, the id's of the nodes/edges are used as key.\n\nMember `network.clustering` contains the following items:\n\n- `clusteredNodes` - hash with values: { clusterId: <id of cluster>, node: <node instance>}\n- `clusteredEdges` - hash with values: restore information for given edge\n\n\nDue to nesting of clusters, these members can contain cluster nodes and edges as well.\n\nThe important thing to note here, is that the clustered nodes and edges also\nappear in the members of the cluster nodes. For data update, it is therefore \nimportant to scan these lists as well as the cluster nodes.\n\n\n### Cluster Node\n\nA cluster node has the following extra fields:\n\n- `isCluster : true` - indication that this is a cluster node\n- `containedNodes`   - hash of nodes contained in this cluster\n- `containedEdges`   - same for edges\n- `edges`            - array of cluster edges for this node \n\n\n**NOTE:**\n\n- `containedEdges` can also contain edges which are not clustered; e.g. an edge\n   connecting two nodes in the same cluster.\n\n\n### Cluster Edge\n\nThese are the items in the `edges` member of a clustered node. They have the\nfollowing relevant members:\n\n- 'clusteringEdgeReplacingIds` - array of id's of edges replaced by this edge\n\nNote that it's possible to nest clusters, so that `clusteringEdgeReplacingIds`\ncan contain edge id's of other clusters.\n\n\n### Clustered Edge\n\nThis is any edge contained by a cluster edge. It gets the following additional\nmember:\n\n- `edgeReplacedById` - id of the cluster edge in which current edge is clustered\n\n\n
